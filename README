IMAP::BodyStructure version 0.95
===============================

An IMAP4-compatible IMAP server MUST include a full MIME-parser which
parses the messages inside IMAP mailboxes and is accessible via
BODYSTRUCTURE fetch item. This module provides a perl interface to
parse the output of IMAP4 MIME-parser. Hope no one will have problems
with parsing previous sentence.

It is a rather straightforward m/\G.../gc-style parser and is
therefore faster then the venerable Mail::IMAPClient::BodyStructure.

This module does not contain IMAP4 client! You will need to employ one
from CPAN, there are many.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Build.PL
   perl Build
   perl Build test
   perl Build install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires an IMAP client package to be of any use.
