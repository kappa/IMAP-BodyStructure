Revision history for Perl extension IMAP::BodyStructure.

1.01
	- INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE:
		->part_at() with wrong part path now returns undef
		instead of automatically climbing up the tree.

	- be more smart (follow RFC) when filling {*_full} members
		of envelope addresses
	- defined but empty (or 0) disposition should mean `inline'
	- speed up several busy regexen by a factor of 2-5.
	- ->charset will never return mysterious '' or '0' instead
	  of `undef'.

0.96  2005/11/16
	- ->{parts} for singlepart messages is now a '[]'.

0.95  2005/08/01
	- use fields;

	- English fixes in doc;

	- Create subs by assigning anonsubs to globs rather than
	  evaling.

	- "reply-to" in envelopes is now "reply_to",
	  "in-reply-to" is "in_reply_to".

	- Fix "part_id" for singlepart messages (it is '1', surprise).

0.91  Mon, 6 September 2004 18:15 (MSD)
	- use Test::NoWarnings in test.pl.
	
	- Do not choke on literal of more than 32766 chars (/.{}/ limit).

	to information loss. Clarify docs on the issue.
